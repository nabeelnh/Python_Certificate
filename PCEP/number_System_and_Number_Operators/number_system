# Number Systems

There are 4 common number systems:

decimal = base 10           =>  from 0 - 9
binary = base 2             =>  from 0 - 1
octal = base 8              =>  from 0 - 7
hexadecimal = base 16       =>  from 0 - 15

Converting one numbering system to another:

You have to divide the original number by the base of the numbering system you're converting into.
The first division is the least significant number and the last is the most significant.

Decimal ==> binary

e.g. 15
15 / 2 => 7 w/ remainder of 1
7 / 2 => 3 w/ remainder of 1
3 / 2 => 1 w/ remainder of 1
1 / 2 => 0 w/ remainder of 1

== 1111

e.g. 12 
12 / 2 => 6 w/ remainder of 0
6 / 2 => 3 w/ remainder of 0
3 / 2 = 1 w/ remainder of 1
1 / 2 = 0 w/ remainder of 1

== 1100

Binary ==> decimal

Place your most significant value on the left hand side.
Multiple the reminders by the base you're converting from i.e. 2
Increase power (exponent) value from right to left.

e.g. 12 
(1 * 2 ^ 3) + (1 * 2 ^ 2) + (0 * 2 ^ 1) + (0 * 2 ^ 0)
(1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1)
8 + 4 + 0 + 0
12

Representing Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Numbers in Python

Binary uses 'b'
Octal uses 'o'
Hexadecimal uses 'x'

8 + 4 + 0 + 0
12

Representing Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Numbers in Python

Binary uses 'b'
Octal uses 'o'
Hexadecimal uses 'x'

e.g. 
12 in binary 0b1100
12 in octal 0o14
12 in hexadecimal 0xc
